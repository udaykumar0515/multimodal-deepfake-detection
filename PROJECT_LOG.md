# Project Log

Permanent implementation history for **Deepfake Detection Using Multimodal Learning**.

## 2026-09-06

- **Stage:** Project governance and baseline confirmation
- **Task performed:** Adopted the supplied master project instruction as the governing implementation and documentation policy. Inspected the implementation blueprint, dataset audit outputs, Git status, recent commit history, and configured GitHub remote.
- **Why it was performed:** The project requires a traceable laboratory notebook before implementation proceeds, and all future work must remain aligned with the finalized methodology and the locally audited dataset.
- **Implementation/details:**
  - Confirmed the repository remote is `https://github.com/udaykumar0515/multimodal-deepfake-detection.git`.
  - Confirmed the current branch is `main` and the latest commit is `f8eed83` (`Add Verifications for Label Integrity and Identity Split Statistics`).
  - Confirmed `.gitignore` excludes `Dataset_FakeAVCeleb/`, `Docs/`, notebook checkpoints, and Python cache files. The raw dataset will remain local and uncommitted.
  - Confirmed the blueprint’s first implementation stage is dataset preparation: identity-based splitting, CSV generation, video preprocessing, audio preprocessing, and PyTorch loaders.
  - Created this project log as the permanent record for implementation decisions and verification evidence.
- **Verification performed:** Read the current blueprint and audit output files; checked Git status, remote configuration, recent history, and ignore rules. No code or raw dataset files were changed.
- **Results:** Repository governance and the intended Phase 1 sequence are confirmed. The repository currently has a modified audit notebook and an untracked implementation plan; both pre-existing changes were preserved.
- **Problems/issues discovered:** The source documents contain an unresolved real-sample count discrepancy. The audit output reports 1,500 real samples in its folder summary and 500 real samples in its sample inspection, while the blueprint defines 1,000 real visual samples and uses that figure for the visual split. The audit also reports 21,544 videos and 21,566 metadata rows. These figures must be reconciled against the actual metadata and filesystem before generating split CSVs.
- **Decisions made:** Do not begin dataset split generation using an assumed count. Reconcile metadata labels, filesystem paths, and identity assignments first. Do not alter the raw dataset or redesign the finalized architecture without explicit approval.
- **Files created/modified:** Created `PROJECT_LOG.md`. No existing files were modified by this task.
- **Next step:** Reconcile the dataset audit discrepancy with a reproducible metadata/filesystem validation, then implement and verify identity-based train/validation/test CSV generation.
